IE 412: Sustainable & Agile Supply Chain Management

This repository contains strategic frameworks, analytical case studies, and optimization models developed during the IE 412: Supply Chain Management course. The project focuses on re-engineering traditional logistics into high-velocity, eco-efficient networks.

🚀 Key Frameworks & Solutions

1. Sustainability & Eco-Efficiency (Ch 13)

Resource Footprint Mapping: Detailed lifecycle assessments across Design–Source–Make–Deliver–Return.

Transport Intensity Optimization: Strategies to reduce "Empty Mile" waste using consolidation and shared distribution models.

Triple Bottom Line (TBL): Balancing Profit, Planet (Carbon/Water Footprints), and People (Safety/Urban Congestion).

2. Supply Chain Agility (Ch 5 & 6)

Form Postponement: Implementing delayed product configuration to bridge the Lead-Time Gap.

The Supply Chain Fulcrum: Utilizing Demand Visibility to substitute physical inventory with information.

3. Resilience & Risk (Ch 10)

Flexibility vs. Redundancy: Case analysis on maintaining operations during infrastructure failures (e.g., Indus Highway flooding).

The "River & Rocks" Analogy: Identifying operational bottlenecks through systematic inventory reduction.

📦 Case Studies Included

Interloop Ltd: Circularity and textile waste recovery (Reverse Logistics).

Engro Foods: Cold-chain optimization and urban Micro-Hub implementation.

Master Paints: Applying postponement logic to retail distribution.
